<h2 class="header">Description</h2>How does it work? It's really <div class="desc" style="display: none;">simple: you just play! The coach shows you the moves a Grandmaster would pick. Not just one move, but the 4 best moves.<br />
<br />
Sounds silly? Well think about it... How did you learn to talk when you were a child? Did you take grammar and spelling lessons? Of course not. You just went with the flow! Because that's the most effective way to learn!<br />
<br />
Chess Tiger Pro allows you to do just that, AND IT WORKS!<br />
<br />
In two minutes you start learning effortlessly. You start having fun immediately, and notice after just a few games that the right moves come to your mind naturally, as if they were obvious.<br />
